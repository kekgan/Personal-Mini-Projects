As you depart for Republic City upon Lefty's back, you sit upright and start meditating.
You close your eyes and take a deep breath.
Soon, you find yourself in the spirit world, right where you wanted to be.
But something wasn't right.
It was too quiet, eerily quiet.
You try to shout to garner attention, but nothing so much as a sigh comes out.
Out of nowhere, you feel a familiar warmth behind you.
You turn around and find yourself face to face with a woman in traditional Water Tribe clothing, on the back of a polar bear dog.

With a quick snap of his fingers, the environment around you snaps back to life.
