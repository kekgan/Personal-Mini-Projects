YOUR   ROOM,???: So you must be the new Avatar.,"Kuya: And who might you be? I don't have the time for this right now. *Looks up* Woah, you're a spirit!"
YOUR   ROOM,???: Not just any spirit.,"Kuya: Hang on, I know you. I've seen the statues of you. You're..."
YOUR   ROOM,Both: Avatar Korra.,Avatar Korra: I noticed you've been honing your spiritual side. So maybe it's time we had a conversation.
YOUR   ROOM,Kuya: About what?,"Avatar Korra: About 70 years ago, I had a battle with Vaatu, the spirit of chaos, during the Harmonic Convergence. "
YOUR   ROOM,"Avatar Korra: It was my duty to defeat him and seal him. That battle would determine the fate of the world until the next harmonic convergence 10,000 years later.","Kuya: Yes I've heard about it. You defeated the Dark Avatar Spirit in Republic City's waters, didn't you?"
YOUR   ROOM,"Avatar Korra: Yes, but it didn't come without a cost. Not many people know about this.",Kuya: What do you mean?
YOUR   ROOM,"Avatar Korra: You and I are only speaking like we are now because we're connected by the Avatar spirit. Or rather Raava, the spirit of peace. During my battle with Vaatu, I was separated from Raava for a while.","Kuya: But you fused with Raava again, didn’t you?"
YOUR   ROOM,"Avatar Korra: Yes, but that period apart severed Raava's and consequently, my connection to all the past Avatars.",Kuya: What does that mean for me?
YOUR   ROOM,"Avatar Korra: It means unless you can find another way to reconnect with the spirits of past Avatars, I'm the only one you've got. And trust me, I spent my whole life trying to do just that.","Kuya: So I'm, put at a disadvantage compared to our predecessors even before I officially start my job?"
YOUR   ROOM,"Avatar Korra: Yes, and I'm sorry that that's all I can leave you with. But I have to go now. It seems an old friend of mine has come bearing news.",???: *Knocks on door*
YOUR   ROOM,Kuya: Come in.,"Master Kai: Hey, buddy. Is this is a bad time? Heard you speaking to someone. Woah, you don't look too good."
YOUR   ROOM,Kuya: No it's fine. Is something the matter?,"Master Kai: I know we're only heading back to Ba Sing Se next week, but you've been invited to attend Avatar Day in Chin Village. You don't have to force yourself if you're not feeling up to it."
YOUR   ROOM,"Kuya: It's alright, I'll go. What's it about?","Master Kai: It's a festival to celebrate the day Avatar Aang saved the village from the Fire Nation, along with all the other Avatars. It happens in a couple of days. We can stop by there and then head back to Ba Sing Se."
YOUR   ROOM,"Master Kai: In any case, get yourself prepped; it'll be your first official appearance as the Avatar.","Kuya: Okay, thank you master."
