You head over to your training grounds to formally start your Avatar training.
You will begin by perfecting your earthbending, followed by firebending, airbending and lastly, waterbending.
After battles, your proficiency in bending each element will increase based on how much you used that element in battle.
When you reach level 2 in the element you're training, you'd have mastered the basics of the element.
You will then take on your respective bending master to prove yourself in an assessment.
Once you've bested all 4 masters, you'll be recognised as a full fledged Avatar.
Only then will your journey truly begin.
