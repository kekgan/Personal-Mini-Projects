TAMA   CAVE,"Kuya: Master Tien, what are you doing here?",Tien: I'm surprised you still remember me.
TAMA   CAVE,Kuya: Of course I remember you. You taught me everything I know.,"Tien: And once you thought you were better than me, you went around ebating all the masters in the region. You never looked back. Not a visit, not a letter, not a squeak from you."
TAMA   CAVE,Kuya: That's ridiculous.,"Tien: Of course it is. It's ridiculous that you never thanked me. As far as I'm concerned, I gave you everything you have now."
TAMA   CAVE,Kuya: That's even more absurd. Why are you doing this?,"Tien: I'm glad you asked. After I heard you found you were the Avatar, I was ecstatic. MY student was the Avatar. I was expecting you to come back to me and ask me to hone your Earthbending. Instead you went to that phony Khoshah."
TAMA   CAVE,Kuya: What does Master Khoshah have to do with any of this?,"Tien: HE HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT! You thought I wasn't good enough to be your master anymore. I've spent every waking moment since then dedicating myself to new forms, ways to improve my bending, anything to get your recognition."
TAMA   CAVE,Kuya: What does that have to do with all the dark and angered spirits everywhere?,"Tien: In my research, I found ways to supplement my Earthbending with spiritual power. Then I came across books and articles about Vaatu."
TAMA   CAVE,Kuya: Vaatu isn't something you should be messing with.,Tien: Being the Avatar doesn't make you better at spiritual matters than me. Vaatu was the missing piece in my research. His dark spiritual energy put my limits over even yours. 
TAMA   CAVE,Kuya: So you're the one who's been angering and converting these spirits?,"Tien: They were simply the means to an end. And that end is the end of you. Right here, right now."
