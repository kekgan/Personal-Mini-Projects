FOREST,"Avatar Korra: Back at you, Avatar Aang. I thought all the past Avatars' spirits were gone.",Kuya: Avatar Aang?!?
FOREST,Avatar Aang: Our connections were severed. That doesn't mean the previous Avatars' spirits were destroyed.,Avatar Korra: I see. And the other Avatars?
FOREST,Avatar Aang: Alive and well. Or at least as alive and well a spirit could be.,Avatar Korra: And what was this attack about?
FOREST,Avatar Aang: I apologise. I was blinded by my anger. The other spirits were angry and I got caught up in it. I don't know much but what I do know is that someone is stirring up trouble in the spirit world.,Kuya: How do you mean?
FOREST,Master Kai: Kuya! What are you doing here? Who are you talking to?,"Kuya: Them. Huh, where did they go? Anyway, sorry for leaving the festival so suddenly."

ABOARD   LEFTY,"Kuya: Master, we have some time before we reach Republic City. I'll head over to the spirit world to check things out there.","Master Kai: Okay, but be careful."
