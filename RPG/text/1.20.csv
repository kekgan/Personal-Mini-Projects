ARENA   ENTRANCE,???: You're the Avatar? You look so… weak.,Kuya: Nice to meet you too.

ARENA   ENTRANCE,Master Eska: Of course not. I'm probably one of the few people to ever meet two Avatars before they fully realise their powers. That means I get to kick your ass.,Kuya: Oh it’s on.
ARENA   ENTRANCE,"Master Eska: Water is the element of change. Stay fluid and manipulate the flow of energy, use your environment to your advantage and you'll devastate any enemy that tries to pick a fight with you.","Kuya: Like I said, bring it on."
