With no earth to bend, your back is against the wall.
You look around in another desperate bid to find a rock or stone, even the tiniest grain of sand.
The crook balls up his fist, preparing to throw one last fireball at you to finish you off.
You feel something well up in your chest.
A little bit of everything; 
Anger, fear, urgency, but nonetheless, the will to fight back shines through.
You see a flash of white and all of a sudden, it feels like time had stopped flowing.
At the very least, for everyone except yourself.
You feel youself moving, but your own body stayed perfectly still, almost as if you were getting transported out of your body.
Soon, you're glowing blue and you come face to face with someone else.
It isn't God, his eyes are glowing white.
It isn't Herobrine, but rather the face of someone you recognise.
You were looking at yourself, in what you would come to know as the Avatar State.
And then time started flowing again.
You, or rather your body, deflect the crook's fireball with ease and quickly throw another stronger one back his way.
And then it hits you... you're the Avatar.
And your life is about to change in unimaginable ways.
