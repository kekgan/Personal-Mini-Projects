CITY   HALL,"Master Khoshah: Avatar Kuya, we're concerned for you.",Kuya: Are you serious?
CITY   HALL,Master Eska: You're acting cold and aggressive towards everyone.,Master Mou: *Nods* (They're right. We're just showing our concern.)
CITY   HALL,"Master Kai: You haven't been telling me, but I know you've been facing off against many dark spirits.",Master Eska: And even your Avatar predecessors.
CITY   HALL,Master Khoshah: Is there anything more you're hiding from us?,Kuya: Avatar Kuruk. He mentioned that something similar happened to him in his lifetime. He was affected by the dark spirits and it drained away at his vitality.
CITY   HALL,Master Mou: *Shakes head* (Then we need to handle this situation swiftly. We don't have time to waste.),Master Eska: he's right. We'll have to weed out the root of the problem rather than keep on putting out these fires as they come up.
CITY   HALL,Kuya: Avatars Kuruk and Kyoshi both mentioned suspicious men in the spirit realm near Republic City's portal acting suspiciously with metallic devices.,"Master Khoshah: We'll look into it. In the meantime, head off to the Western Air Temple and deal with one last hotspot."
FOUR,DAYS,LATER
WESTERN   AIR   TEMPLE,Master Kai: We're here.,Kuya: Does no one live here?
WESTERN   AIR   TEMPLE,Master Kai: Not since before the Hundred Year War. It got pretty banged up when an assassin followed Avatar Aang here.,Kuya: How are we gonna find our spirits then?
WESTERN   AIR   TEMPLE,"Master Kai: Before that, if this is who we think it is, you're gonna have to be careful.","Kuya: Based on the pattern, I expect we'd meet Avatar Yangchen here."
WESTERN   AIR   TEMPLE,"Master Kai: I concur. And that's not a good thing. She has storng willpower and is perhaps one of the most skilled benders ever. If she's turned, we'll be in for a hell of a battle.",Kuya: Let's look around.
WESTERN   AIR   TEMPLE,Master Kai: No need.,Kuya: Why not?
WESTERN   AIR   TEMPLE,Master Kai: They're here. I got the spirits. You take Yangchen.,Avatar Yangchen: Who dares disturb my Air Temple?!
